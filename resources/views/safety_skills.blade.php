            <p><b>It does more than help save lives.</b> Giving appropriate first aid immediately can help to reduce a person’s recovery time and make the difference between the patient having a temporary or long term disability. You’ll learn how to remain calm in emergency situations and you’ll learn simple acronyms to help you recall the steps you need to take. First aid training will make you confident and comfortable and therefore more effective and in control when you need to be.</p>

            <p><b>The fire extinguisher is more effective when the person using it knows how to hold and aim it properly.</b> The person operating a fire extinguisher is less likely to hurt themselves attempting to put out the fire when they receive proper training first. Using the wrong type of extinguisher could make the flames worse. Training ensures your employees know what symbol on the front of the fire extinguisher corresponds with which type of fire.</p>

            <h3>Natural Gas</h3>
            <p><b>Natural gas leaks and explosions cause a significant number of fires after disasters.</b> It's important that all household members know how to shut off natural gas.</p>
            <p>There are different gas shut-off procedures for different gas meter configurations, so it's important to call your gas company. They can help you prepare for gas appliances and gas service to your home in the event of an emergency.</p>
            <p>Make sure everyone in your household knows the proper shut-off procedure for your meter. Do not actually turn off the gas when practicing shutting it off.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and get everyone out quickly. Turn off the gas using the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor’s home.</li>
                <li>Caution: If you turn off the gas for any reason, only a qualified professional can turn it back on. NEVER attempt to turn the gas back on yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Watch all about it <a href="">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p><b>Although it is of utmost importance, water quickly becomes a precious resource following many disasters.</b> It is important that everyone in your household learn how to shut off the main water valve to the house.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find the shut-off valve for the main water line that enters your house and tag it for easy identification. Make sure everyone in your household knows where it is.</li>
                <li>Make you can shut the valve off completely. Your valve may be rusted open or it may not close all the way. If so replace it.</li>
                <li>Cracked lines may pollute the water supply to your house. It's a good idea to shut off your water until authorities say it's safe to drink.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The effects of gravity may drain the water in your hot water heater and toilet tanks unless you trap it in your house by shutting off the main house valve. (This is not the street valve in the cement box at the curb – the street valve is extremely difficult to turn and requires a special tool.)</p>

                <li>Locate you electrical circuit box. For your safety, always shut off all the individual circuits before shutting off the main circuit.</li>
